## Gluttony: A Personal Game Engine Project

Gluttony is a product of personal passion and a journey into the world of game development. It's not about grandiose claims or promises of industry-shaking innovations. Instead, it's a quiet endeavor, created for the simple joy of bringing ideas to life, learning, coding, and design, undertaken simply for the joy of creation.

A central focus of Gluttony lies in Procedural Mesh Generation. This feature allows for the dynamic creation of meshes, offering exciting possibilities for generating adaptable landscapes, structures, and worlds. It's a tool that empowers you to craft environments that respond in real-time to various parameters.

It's worth noting that Gluttony, as my first self-coded game engine, may have some features that are still in development or may not be as polished as you'd find in established engines or even missing entirely. 

In the end, Gluttony is a canvas, a playground, and an opportunity to learn game development. Embrace it for what it is: an imperfect engine, an opportunity to learn, a space for exploration, and a platform to bring your ideas to life.
